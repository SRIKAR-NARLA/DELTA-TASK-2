        <p>Defend yourself against a relentless zombie apocalypse. Set up a base to protect yourself before the invasion begins. As the game starts, zombies invade from both sides, attempting to reach the survivor. Zombies damage and destroy any blocks in their path, allowing them to advance. The survivor can move and shoot zombies to prevent them from getting close. The game ends if the survivor loses all health and is overtaken by the zombies.</p>
